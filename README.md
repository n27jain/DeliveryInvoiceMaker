DeliveryInvoiceMaker
**Last Update:** 01/07/2021

## Description:
A web app that can store products and their details on a database and allow users to access those items to automatically create invoices and reciepts in pdf format. Users can track the previous sales price and quantity used as well as have details ready in regards to use. The overall objective for making this app was to quickly an efficiently learn python and flask in order to be able to host a web apps for hackathons and personal projects. 

## Purpose :

I made this app for ValueSmart Trading Inc, where regular invoices needed to be created to provide clients with prices quotes and to create a reciept of all transactions done.
This app allows anyone who has no knowledge on opperating word and excel to create invoices quickly and to help keep track of purchases and sales. Previously memebers would use a word template to manually add items to the invoice sheets but this prevents any sort of analysis opporturnity which can be performed by scraping excel sheets. This app conviently does everything using a user friendly interface.

This app will also provide insights for yearly progression and can be used for filing revenue reports. 
Since I am a shareholder of the company I made the decesion to make this open source for anyone to use and modify since many companies can benefit from this.

## Features

## Problems
  - Heroku web hosting is giving us grief since v13. The current workaround is using pyinstaller to make an executable to share with the non-techincal people. Regular users can simply run the code to access the website locally.
