DeliveryInvoiceMaker
**Last Update:** 12/27/2020

## Description:
A web app that can store products and their details on a database and allow users to access those items to automatically create invoices and reciepts in pdf format.

## Purpose :

I made this app for ValueSmart Trading Inc, where regular invoices needed to be created to provide clients with prices quotes and to create a reciept of all transactions done.
This app allows anyone who has no knowledge on opperating word and excel to create invoices quickly and to help keep track of purchases and sales. 
This app will also provide insights for yearly progression and can be used for filing revenue reports. 
Since I am a shareholder of the company I made the decsion to make this open source for anyone to use and modify since many companies can benefit from this.
